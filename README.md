Overview

We would like you to write a mobile based web app without any backend. Below is the user story, followed by the design.
Profile page:

• When the app opens, the profile should be displayed.
• When the user clicks the "add as friend" button, the site background and button colors should change (to the colors of your choice). When clicked for a second time, the original colors should return.
• When a user clicks on a profile image on the home page, the chat page should open.


Chat page:

• When the chat is opened, a random message from the other user should appear.
• Users should be able to send messages from the chat window.
• The message history should remain in the chat window for the duration of the session, even if the user returns to the home page.
• When the user clicks the avatar on the chat page, or the back button, he should go to the profile page.


Other:

• Libraries and frameworks are ok if you want to use them.
• Please don't use any automatic code generation.
• Closing the app window should close the session.
• Remember this is a mobile based web app, so we would like it to be compatible with major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera).
